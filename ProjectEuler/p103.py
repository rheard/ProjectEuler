"""
Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it
    a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C,
    the following properties are true:

    1. S(B) != S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
    2. If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).

If S(A) is minimised for a given n, we shall call it an optimum special sum set.
    The first five optimum special sum sets are given below.

n = 1: {1}
n = 2: {1, 2}
n = 3: {2, 3, 4}
n = 4: {3, 5, 6, 7}
n = 5: {6, 9, 11, 12, 13}

It seems that for a given optimum set, A = {a_1, a_2, ... , a_n},
    the next optimum set is of the form B = {b, a_1+b, a_2+b, ... ,a_n+b},
    where b is the "middle" element on the previous row.

By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for n = 6 to be
    A = {11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24}, with S(A) = 117. However, this is not the optimum set,
    as we have merely applied an algorithm to provide a near optimum set. The optimum set
    for n = 6 is A = {11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25}, with S(A) = 115 and corresponding set string:
    111819202225.

Given that A is an optimum special sum set for n = 7, find its set string.

NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 105 and Problem 106.
