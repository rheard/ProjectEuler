# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, organized as importable Python modules.

Each problem is implemented as its own module, and can be run collectively or individually using the `__main__.py` entry point.

## Usage

After installing, you can run all solved problems by running the script using:

```bash
python -m ProjectEuler
```

Additionally, you can run specific problems by providing them in command line:

```bash
python -m ProjectEuler p007 p008
```
